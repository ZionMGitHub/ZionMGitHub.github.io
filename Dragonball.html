        <p id="content">Dragon Ball Z is a popular spinoff of the also popular original series Dragon Ball. Dragon Ball
            Z originally aired in Japan in the late 1980s and ran through the mid-'90s with the English version airing 
            in the US during the 2000s and 2010's. The show continues to follow its main character Goku and his band of 
            friends as the defend earth from certian destruction. Dragon Ball Z represents a much simpler time in my 
            life. The action-packed storyline kept me and my peers engaged for hours, as we watched our favorite characters
            settle their differences the best way they knew how; Kung Fu! Here are few of my favorite/most memerable characters.
